# A Personal Website
This project is a personal website developed by Viraj Bhingare. The project depicts a raw layout of the website structured and stylized using HTML and CSS only. The project is just an initial step towards creating a potential website. Since the project is built only using HTML and CSS, there is oddles of need for further improvisations and refactoring.

The project is a part of an Audit Course named "Industry Ready Web Developer".

## Highlights
* The project consists of three pages named `home.html`, `contact.html` and `about.html`.
* A Navbar with links directing each page.
* A Footer with a link to the github repository (on clicking the github icon).
